# Weather App using Open weather API

* Used node js as proxy server to handle API calls
* Deployed: https://weather-lilac-ten.vercel.app
  
> P.S. Initially deployed static site using only HTML, Javascript where encountered API key exposed client side issue so used server side using Express to handle API calls
